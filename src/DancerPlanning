  Direction of rotation
  speed of rotation

Moving Dancer -
  fromLocation property (maybe)
  toLocation property
  speed of movement
  translation function

  Subclasses:
    Bouncy Dancer -
      TBD
      parabolic functions - y = a * x^2 + b * x + c
        determine a, b and c variables and then the constraints of y and x as positions
        execute the function over some sort of set timeout...
        (probably over thinking this.)
